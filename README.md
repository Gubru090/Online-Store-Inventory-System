# Online-Store-Inventory-System  
This project is a SQL-based Inventory Management System that manages products, categories, suppliers, and their relationships using MySQL.  
It includes table creation with proper keys, data insertion, and 15 useful queries to analyze and manage inventoryâ€”such as finding top suppliers, checking stock levels, calculating total inventory value, and more.  
The project demonstrates real-world database design with many-to-many and one-to-many relationships, making it a great practice for learning SQL and relational databases.
